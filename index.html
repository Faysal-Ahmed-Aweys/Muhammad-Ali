        <p>
          Muhammad Ali (1942-2016) was an American former heavyweight champion
          boxer and one of the greatest sporting figures of the 20th century. An
          Olympic gold medalist and the first fighter to capture the heavyweight
          title three times, Ali won 56 times in his 21-year professional
          career. Ali’s outspokenness on issues of race, religion and politics
          made him a controversial figure during his career, and the
          heavyweight’s quips and taunts were as quick as his fists. Born
          Cassius Clay Jr., Ali changed his name in 1964 after joining the
          Nation of Islam. Citing his religious beliefs, he refused military
          induction and was stripped of his heavyweight championship and banned
          from boxing for three years during the prime of his career.
          Parkinson’s syndrome severely impaired Ali’s motor skills and speech,
          but he remained active as a humanitarian and goodwill ambassador.

          <h2>Muhammad Ali’s Early Years and Amateur Career</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr., the elder son of Cassius Marcellus Clay
            Sr. (1912-1990) and Odessa Grady Clay (1917-1994), was born on
            January 17, 1942, in Louisville, Kentucky. It was a red-and-white
            Schwinn that steered the future heavyweight champion to the sport of
            boxing. When his beloved bicycle was stolen, a tearful 12-year-old
            Clay reported the theft to Louisville police officer Joe Martin
            (1916-1996) and vowed to pummel the culprit. Martin, who was also a
            boxing trainer, suggested that the upset youngster first learn how
            to fight, and he took Clay under his wing. Six weeks later, Clay won
            his first bout in a split decision.<br /><br />
            By age 18 Clay had captured two national Golden Gloves titles, two
            Amateur Athletic Union national titles and 100 victories against
            eight losses. After graduating high school, he traveled to Rome and
            won the light heavyweight gold medal in the 1960 Summer Olympics.<br /><br />
            Clay won his professional boxing debut on October 29, 1960, in a
            six-round decision. From the start of his pro career, the
            6-foot-3-inch heavyweight overwhelmed his opponents with a
            combination of quick, powerful jabs and foot speed, and his constant
            braggadocio and self-promotion earned him the nickname “Louisville
            Lip.”

          <h2>Muhammad Ali: Heavyweight Champion of the World</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            After winning his first 19 fights, including 15 knockouts, Clay
            received his first title shot on February 25, 1964, against reigning
            heavyweight champion Sonny Liston (1932-1970). Although he arrived
            in Miami Beach, Florida, a 7-1 underdog, the 22-year-old Clay
            relentlessly taunted Liston before the fight, promising to “float
            like a butterfly, sting like a bee” and predicting a knockout. When
            Liston failed to answer the bell at the start of the seventh round,
            Clay was indeed crowned heavyweight champion of the world. In the
            ring after the fight, the new champ roared, “I am the greatest!”<br /><br />At
            a press conference the next morning, Clay, who had been seen around
            Miami with controversial Nation of Islam member Malcolm X
            (1925-1965), confirmed the rumors of his conversion to Islam. On
            March 6, 1964, Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad (1897-1975)
            bestowed on Clay the name of Muhammad Ali.<br /><br />Ali solidified
            his hold on the heavyweight championship by knocking out Liston in
            the first round of their rematch on May 25, 1965, and he defended
            his title eight more times. Then, with the Vietnam War raging, Ali
            showed up for his scheduled induction into the U.S. Armed Forces on
            April 28, 1967. Citing his religious beliefs, he refused to serve.
            Ali was arrested, and the New York State Athletic Commission
            immediately suspended his boxing license and revoked his heavyweight
            belt.<br /><br />Convicted of draft evasion, Ali was sentenced to
            the maximum of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine, but he
            remained free while the conviction was appealed. Many saw Ali as a
            draft dodger, and his popularity plummeted. Banned from boxing for
            three years, Ali spoke out against the Vietnam War on college
            campuses. As public attitudes turned against the war, support for
            Ali grew. In 1970 the New York State Supreme Court ordered his
            boxing license reinstated, and the following year the U.S. Supreme
            Court overturned his conviction in a unanimous decision.

          <h2>Muhammad Ali’s Return to the Ring</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            After 43 months in exile, Ali returned to the ring on October 26,
            1970, and knocked out Jerry Quarry (1945-1999) in the third round.
            On March 8, 1971, Ali got his chance to regain his heavyweight crown
            against reigning champ Joe Frazier (1944-2011) in what was billed as
            the “Fight of the Century.” The undefeated Frazier floored Ali with
            a hard left hook in the final round. Ali got up but lost in a
            unanimous decision, experiencing his first defeat as a pro.<br /><br />Ali
            won his next 10 bouts before being defeated by Ken Norton (1943-).
            He won the rematch six months later in a split decision and gained
            further revenge in a unanimous decision over Frazier in a non-title
            rematch. The victory gave the 32-year-old Ali a title shot against
            25-year-old champion George Foreman (1949-). The October 30, 1974,
            fight in Kinshasa, Zaire, was dubbed the “Rumble in the Jungle.”
            Ali, the decided underdog, employed his “rope-a-dope” strategy,
            leaning on the ring ropes and absorbing a barrage of blows from
            Foreman while waiting for his opponent to tire. The strategy worked,
            and Ali won in an eighth-round knockout to regain the title stripped
            from him seven years prior.<br /><br />Ali successfully defended his
            title in 10 fights, including the memorable “Thrilla in Manila” on
            October 1, 1975, in which his bitter rival Frazier, his eyes swollen
            shut, was unable to answer the bell for the final round. Ali also
            defeated Norton in their third meeting in a unanimous 15-round
            decision.<br /><br />On February 15, 1978, an aging Ali lost his
            title to Leon Spinks (1953-) in a 15-round split decision. Seven
            months later, Ali defeated Spinks in a unanimous 15-round decision
            to reclaim the heavyweight crown and become the first fighter to win
            the world heavyweight boxing title three times. After announcing his
            retirement in 1979, Ali launched a brief, unsuccessful comeback.
            However, he was overwhelmed in a technical knockout loss to Larry
            Holmes (1949-) in 1980, and he dropped a unanimous 10-round decision
            to Trevor Berbick (1954-2006) on December 11, 1981. After the fight,
            the 39-year-old Ali retired for good with a career record of 56
            wins, five losses and 37 knockouts.

          <p class="text-content">
            In 1984 Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson’s syndrome, possibly
            connected to the severe head trauma suffered during his boxing
            career. The former champion’s motor skills slowly declined, and his
            movement and speech were limited. In spite of the Parkinson’s, Ali
            remained in the public spotlight, traveling the world to make
            humanitarian, goodwill and charitable appearances. He met with Iraqi
            leader Saddam Hussein (1937-2006) in 1990 to negotiate the release
            of American hostages, and in 2002 he traveled to Afghanistan as a
            United Nations Messenger of Peace.<br /><br />Ali had the honor of
            lighting the cauldron during the opening ceremonies of the 1996
            Summer Olympics in Atlanta. In 1999 Ali was voted the BBC’s
            “Sporting Personality of the Century,” and Sports Illustrated named
            him “Sportsman of the Century.” Ali was awarded the Presidential
            Medal of Freedom in a 2005 White House ceremony, and in the same
            year the $60 million Muhammad Ali Center, a nonprofit museum and
            cultural center focusing on peace and social responsibility, opened
            in Louisville.<br /><br />Ring Magazine named Ali “Fighter of the
            Year” five times, more than any other boxer, and he was inducted
            into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990. Ali has been
            married four times and has seven daughters and two sons. He married
            his fourth wife, Yolanda, in 1986. Ali died at the age of 74 on June
            3, 2016.
