        <h1>Muhammad Ali</h1>
        <p>
          Muhammad Ali (1942-2016) was an American former heavyweight champion
          boxer and one of the greatest sporting figures of the 20th century. An
          Olympic gold medalist and the first fighter to capture the heavyweight
          title three times, Ali won 56 times in his 21-year professional
          career. Ali’s outspokenness on issues of race, religion and politics
          made him a controversial figure during his career, and the
          heavyweight’s quips and taunts were as quick as his fists. Born
          Cassius Clay Jr., Ali changed his name in 1964 after joining the
          Nation of Islam. Citing his religious beliefs, he refused military
          induction and was stripped of his heavyweight championship and banned
          from boxing for three years during the prime of his career.
          Parkinson’s syndrome severely impaired Ali’s motor skills and speech,
          but he remained active as a humanitarian and goodwill ambassador.
