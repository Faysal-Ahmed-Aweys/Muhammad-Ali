# **Muhammad Ali**

Muhammad Ali is a history website that talks about the life of Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. who later changed his name to Muhammad Ali due to his religious conversion from his birth to his death.

## **Planning** 
### **site aims:** 
* To educate users on the history of Muhammad Ali. 
* To Inspire users that they can achieve anything and that nothing is impossible. 

### **User stories:**
* As a user, I want to find out about the life of Muhammad ali from his Birth to the end of his life.
* As a user, I want to see Images of Muhammad ali together with text content to enjoy reading about him.
* As a user, I want to navigate the Website using multiple devices.
* As a user, I want to be able to discuss and ask questions about Muhammad Ali.
* As a user, I want to leave the website educated on the life of Muhammad ali.
* As a user, I want to navigate on the website with ease.

### **Target Audiences:**
* Users who have never heard about Muhammad ali.
* Users who have heard about Muhammad ali but wish to read and learn the history behind him.
* Users who are interested in history of people.
* Users who are looking to be inspired by history of people.

### **What is the plan to achieve this:**

* I am gonna build the website using mobile-first approach. This way I can build a responsive website to achieve navigation on multiple devices.
* The Landing/About page of the website will have a hero image, a section with a summary of his life followed by more detailed information in a later section. In this section, his life is divided into 4 stages accompanied by an image of Muhammad Ali at that stage to enable users to learn about his whole life with an interactive experience to enjoy reading about him.
* A form can be filled out on one of the website pages if one wishes to get in touch with the developer to discuss more about Muhammad Ali or ask questions.
* I will make the website as simple and as clean as possible. The website will have a header with only a name logo, and a navigation bar with links to the pages. The footer will have socials and site aim. I will use simple colors, eye-catching images, and well-defined sections to make navigation of the website easy.

### **wireframes** 
* Mobile wireframes:
   * [Home page](assets/docs/wireframes/Home-page_mobile.png)
   * [Gallery page](assets/docs/wireframes/Gallery-page_mobile.png)
   * [Contact page](assets/docs/wireframes/Contact-page_mobile.png)

* Desktop wireframes: 
  * [Home page](assets/docs/wireframes/Home-page_desktop.png)
  * [Gallery page](assets/docs/wireframes/Gallery-page_desktop.png)
  * [Contact page](assets/docs/wireframes/Contact-page_desktop.png)

Everything on wireframes and the built web pages are the same except for the change of names of pages from "Home" to "About" and "Author" to "Contact". Also I decided to Change the first heading of the contact page to "About the Developer" from "About the Author". This changes to the Contact page are due to a point of correction raised to me by my mentor David Bowers that since the content of the pages are not all mine, I couldn't be the author of the website.  

### **color scheme:**
I decided to choose some shades of white, black and somewhat golden colors in order to make sure the website is as clean as possible in and not too colorful. I chose the golden colors specificly to show the metaphor of the success and popularity of Muhammad Ali.

### **Fonts**

I used open sans font from google fonts for headings, sans serif font for links and serif for content on the pages. These together keep the website clean and the content, easy to read. 

## **Current common Features on all pages**

### **Header**

The header is fixed on the pages. It allows easy navigation between pages on the website. This is to ensure Better user experience and flexibility. I was thinking of making a back to top button but due to the fixed header, it is not necessary. Here are the features of the header:

#### **Logo and title**

I decided to use a clean and simple logo that has the name Muhammad Ali and has shades of gold for color consistensy on the pages.

![Logo and title](/assets/docs/screenshots/logoandtitle.jpg)

#### **Navigation bar**

The navigation bar includes the logo and navigation links. The nav links have an active class that indicates which page the user is on and a hover effect to show that they are clickable links to improve user experience.

### **Footer**

The footer contains links to three social platforms. The links do not take you to any pages that are related to the content of the website. I included these links to give my website some structure and to implement my skills.
A short statement that states the purpose of the website is also included on the footer.

## **Individual page Features**
### **Landing / About page**
This page has a hero image, introduction section and a main section. Here are the features: 

#### **Hero-image**
The home page has a hero image right under the header. This image expresses about Muhammad Ali and shows that he was a great man before a user reads about him to give the users an idea of who the web page is about and attract them to read about him.

### **Thank you page** 
#### **Form feedback**
The form uses GET instead of POST method. This is to improve user experience and to display feedback to the user to indicate that they have successfully completed the form. After the form is filled, The form section changes to thank you section and the rest remain the same on the ccontact page. A youtube video for more history on Muhammad Ali is included in the thank you section to give users more resources on him.

## **Future Enhancements** 
As a static website, I am happy with the current features. However, There can be some changes and additional features to improve the website.

1. With time and resources, I would add more people of history whose lives are inspiring. I would expand the website and add more resources to make it a history website that includes the lives and images of multiple historical figures instead of just one. The reason i didn’t include this feature is because i intended to make the minimal requirement for this project and not risk being late for the deadline.
2. To get in touch with the user, I would change the Form on contact page method from GET to POST and send the form data to the developer's email.
