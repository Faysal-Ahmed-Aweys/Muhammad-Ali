Muhammad Ali is a history website that talks about the life of Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. who later changed his name to Muhammad Ali due to his religious conversion from his birth to his death.

## **Planning** 
### **site aims:** 
* To educate users on the history of Muhammad Ali. 
* To Inspire users that they can achieve anything and that nothing is impossible. 

### **User stories:**
* As a user, I want to find out about the life of Muhammad ali from his Birth to the end of his life.
* As a user, I want to see Images of Muhammad ali together with text content to enjoy reading about him.
* As a user, I want to navigate the Website using multiple devices.
* As a user, I want to be able to discuss and ask questions about Muhammad Ali.
* As a user, I want to leave the website educated on the life of Muhammad ali.
* As a user, I want to navigate on the website with ease.

### **Target Audiences:**
* Users who have never heard about Muhammad ali.
* Users who have heard about Muhammad ali but wish to read and learn the history behind him.
* Users who are interested in history of people.
* Users who are looking to be inspired by history of people.

### **What is the plan to achieve this:**

* I am gonna build the website using mobile-first approach. This way I can build a responsive website to achieve navigation on multiple devices.
* The Landing/About page of the website will have a hero image, a section with a summary of his life followed by more detailed information in a later section. In this section, his life is divided into 4 stages accompanied by an image of Muhammad Ali at that stage to enable users to learn about his whole life with an interactive experience to enjoy reading about him.
* A form can be filled out on one of the website pages if one wishes to get in touch with the developer to discuss more about Muhammad Ali or ask questions.
* I will make the website as simple and as clean as possible. The website will have a header with only a name logo, and a navigation bar with links to the pages. The footer will have socials and site aim. I will use simple colors, eye-catching images, and well-defined sections to make navigation of the website easy.

### **wireframes** 
* Mobile wireframes:
   * [Home page](assets/docs/wireframes/Home-page_mobile.png)
   * [Gallery page](assets/docs/wireframes/Gallery-page_mobile.png)
   * [Contact page](assets/docs/wireframes/Contact-page_mobile.png)

* Desktop wireframes: 
  * [Home page](assets/docs/wireframes/Home-page_desktop.png)
  * [Gallery page](assets/docs/wireframes/Gallery-page_desktop.png)
  * [Contact page](assets/docs/wireframes/Contact-page_desktop.png)

Everything on wireframes and the built web pages are the same except for the change of names of pages from "Home" to "About" and "Author" to "Contact". Also I decided to Change the first heading of the contact page to "About the Developer" from "About the Author". This changes to the Contact page are due to a point of correction raised to me by my mentor David Bowers that since the content of the pages are not all mine, I couldn't be the author of the website.  

### **color scheme:**
I decided to choose some shades of white, black and somewhat golden colors in order to make sure the website is as clean as possible in and not too colorful. I chose the golden colors specificly to show the metaphor of the success and popularity of Muhammad Ali.

1. I clicked on the settings on my repository. 
2. From the menu on the left, I clicked on pages. 
3. under source, i selected "deploy from a branch" and under branch, i selected "main" branch and the root folder. Then i clicked save. 
4. The website was deployed and can be found under deployments on the right menu of the repository.
