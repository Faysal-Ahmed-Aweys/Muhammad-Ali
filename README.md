## **Planning**

* To educate users on the history of Muhammad Ali. 
* To Inspire users that they can achieve anything and that nothing is impossible.

* As a user, I want to navigate on the website with ease.

### **Target Audiences:**
* Users who have never heard about Muhammad ali.
* Users who have heard about Muhammad ali but wish to read and learn the history behind him.
* Users who are interested in history of people.
* Users who are looking to be inspired by history of people.

### **What is the plan to achieve this:**

* I am gonna build the website using mobile-first approach. This way I can build a responsive website to achieve navigation on multiple devices.
* The Landing/About page of the website will have a hero image, a section with a summary of his life followed by more detailed information in a later section. In this section, his life is divided into 4 stages accompanied by an image of Muhammad Ali at that stage to enable users to learn about his whole life with an interactive experience to enjoy reading about him.
* A form can be filled out on one of the website pages if one wishes to get in touch with the developer to discuss more about Muhammad Ali or ask questions.
* I will make the website as simple and as clean as possible. The website will have a header with only a name logo, and a navigation bar with links to the pages. The footer will have socials and site aim. I will use simple colors, eye-catching images, and well-defined sections to make navigation of the website easy.
