        <h1>About the Author</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Faysal Aweys. I have always been interested in history,
          especially history about particular people. I am always passionate
          about hearing stories, reading and also watching documentries and
          movies about hoistory of people. Learning from them and getting
          inspired by them to try and better myself in anyway possible is one of
          the main reasons why I am passionate about history.<br /><br />
          Muhammad Ali is one of the people whose history has been talked to me
          about by many people. He has inspired many with his courage,
          Resilience, Humbleness, selflessness and many other qualities. I for
          one have always heard people talk about him and I ever since had the
          urge to find out more about him. I started to learn more about his
          history and decided to write a website about him.<br /><br />
          I am still interested to know more about him. Also, to know about
          other people of history who are inspiring and would be helpful to read
          about. If you would like to discuss about Muhammad Ali or anything
          related to history which you think you or I can learn from or to
          receive a link of other websites that i make about other history
          people then lets get in touch by leaving me your full name and email
          and the topic you would like to discuss and let's learn to better
          ourselves!
